# Data Visualization: Storytelling

## **Section 1: Why Storytelling**

### Humans are wired for story
	‚Ä¢	Evoke and dissolve unease through crafted tension.
	‚Ä¢	Potent narratives engineer discord only to harmonize it.
	‚Ä¢	Stories ignite neural pathways, mimicking the sensory symphony of lived experience‚Äîsights, sounds, flavors, and motion entwined.

Fiction vs nonfiction (journalistic or documentary storytelling, or data storytelling)

	‚Ä¢	Such tales transcend disbelief, forging conviction in their wake.
	‚Ä¢	The craft of storytelling was a lifeline for early humanity.
	‚Ä¢	Its evolutionary mandate is unmistakable.
	‚Ä¢	Embrace the lens of the storyteller.

### Storytelling is essential

	‚Ä¢	Studies reveal humans devote 70‚Äì80% of their waking hours to the art of communication.
	‚Ä¢	Communication reigns supreme as the most sought-after skill.
	‚Ä¢	A story imprints itself on memory 22 times more deeply than raw facts alone ‚Äî Jennifer Aaker.
	‚Ä¢	Mundane words (e.g., ‚Äúchair‚Äù) stir only the linguistic centers of the brain.
	‚Ä¢	Sensory words (e.g., ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù) awaken neural pathways tied to taste, scent, and experience.
	‚Ä¢	The broader the brain‚Äôs activation, the more vivid, emotional, and resonant the story becomes.
	‚Ä¢	Statistics function like neutral words: informative, but inert.

Interweave data with narrative and awaken the senses. This synthesis ignites thought, emotion, and imagery, embedding the content deeply and irresistibly in the mind.

### Use story even when you don't

![](section-1/event-conflict.jpg)

	‚Ä¢	At its core, every tale demands a genesis, a journey, and a resolution.
	‚Ä¢	Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a deeper cadence: the trials of the protagonist and the crescendo where all tensions converge.

	‚Ä¢	The yellow highlight marks the story‚Äôs resolution, its final note.
	‚Ä¢	The headline serves as the tale‚Äôs opening chord.
	‚Ä¢	The body text unfolds the journey, the middle passage.
	‚Ä¢	The callout text strikes the story‚Äôs apex, the moment of peak tension.
	‚Ä¢	Headlines, callouts, and highlights are potent tools to inject the essential spark: anxiety.
